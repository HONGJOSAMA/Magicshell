# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a minimal, stylish web application that provides a random answer to a user's question from a predefined set of answers. The UI is designed with a "Hip & Minimal" aesthetic, featuring a theme toggle for both light (Off-White) and dark (Deep Black) modes.

## Implemented Features

*   **Dynamic Answer Display:**
    *   The application now provides answers from the set: "Sure", "Pass", "Go", "Wait".
    *   The answer text is styled with a vibrant Purple to RoyalBlue gradient.
*   **User Interface Enhancements:**
    *   The main title is "Magic Shell" with a matching Purple to RoyalBlue gradient.
    *   The input field placeholder is "Random, but Right".
    *   The "Ask" button can be triggered by pressing the Enter key in the input field.
*   **Dual-Theme UI (Light/Dark Mode):**
    *   Users can switch between a light and dark theme.
    *   Theme preference is saved locally.
    *   UI elements adapt their colors based on the selected theme.
*   **Modern Design Aesthetic:**
    *   Clean layout with a "Hip & Minimal" feel, utilizing the 'Inter' San-serif font.
    *   Elements like the container, input field, and buttons have subtle styling transitions.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Maintain and ensure the robustness of the "Magic Shell" application with its light/dark theme capabilities.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Monitor for any bugs or inconsistencies in the theme switching or answer display.
    2.  Consider adding more sophisticated input validation for the question field.
    3.  Explore user-requested enhancements, such as implementing specific "question grammar" if provided.
