# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that provides a random answer to a user's question from a predefined set of answers: "Do It", "Don't Do It", "Yes", and "No". The UI is styled to resemble a military-grade walkie-talkie (AN/PRC-152) for a unique, rugged aesthetic.

## Implemented Features

*   **User Interface:**
    *   A clear and simple interface with a title, a text input for the user's question, a button to submit the question, and a designated area to display the answer.
    *   Responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop browsers.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   When the user clicks the "Ask" button, the application randomly selects one of the four possible answers.
    *   The selected answer is displayed to the user.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Redesign the application to mimic the look and feel of a military walkie-talkie (AN/PRC-152).
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Background:** Apply a dark wood texture to the page background.
    2.  **Main Container:**
        *   Restyle the main container to look like the body of a walkie-talkie using an Olive Drab color scheme and a metallic texture.
        *   Add bolt/screw details to the corners for a more mechanical look.
    3.  **Title:** Change the title to "Report." and style it with a red, digital/dot-matrix font to resemble a device's alert screen.
    4.  **Input Field:** Redesign the question input area to look like an LCD frequency display.
    5.  **Button:** Transform the "Ask" button into a three-dimensional, orange Push-to-Talk (PTT) button.
    6.  **Layout:** Adjust the overall layout to feel more rugged, mechanical, and authentic to the source inspiration.
