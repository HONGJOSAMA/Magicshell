# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that provides a random answer to a user's question from a predefined set of answers: "Do It", "Don't Do It", "Yes", and "No".

## Implemented Features

*   **User Interface:**
    *   A clear and simple interface with a title, a text input for the user's question, a button to submit the question, and a designated area to display the answer.
    *   Responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop browsers.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   When the user clicks the "Ask" button, the application randomly selects one of the four possible answers.
    *   The selected answer is displayed to the user.

## Current Plan

*   Create the basic HTML structure for the application.
*   Style the application using CSS for a visually appealing layout.
*   Implement the JavaScript logic to handle user interaction and generate random answers.
