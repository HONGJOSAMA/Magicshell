# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a minimal, stylish web application that provides a random answer to a user's question from a predefined set of answers. The UI is designed with a "Hip & Minimal" aesthetic, featuring a theme toggle for both light (Off-White) and dark (Deep Black) modes.

## Implemented Features

*   **Dual-Theme UI:**
    *   Users can switch between a light Off-White (#F5F5F7) and a deep Deep Black (#000000) theme.
    *   The theme preference is saved in the user's browser.
    *   The main content is presented in a clean, card-style layout with a subtle **Glassmorphism** effect.
*   **Modern Typography:**
    *   Uses the 'Inter' San-serif font for a clean, modern look.
    *   Features tight letter-spacing for a stylish, "hip" feel.
*   **Dynamic Answer Display:**
    *   The answer to the user's query is displayed prominently in the center of the screen.
    *   The answer text is styled with a premium silver-to-white gradient.
*   **Minimalist Controls:**
    *   The "Ask" button is styled with a simple, clean outline.
    *   A theme toggle button allows for easy switching between light and dark modes.
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   When the user clicks the "Ask" button, the application randomly selects and displays an answer from "Do It", "Don't Do It", "Yes", and "No".

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Redesign the application to a "Hip & Minimal" aesthetic with a dual-theme (light/dark) capability.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Background & Theme:** Implement a theme-switcher for a Deep Black and an Off-White background.
    2.  **Main Container:** Restyle the container as a clean card with a subtle Glassmorphism effect (semi-transparent background, blur, and a fine border).
    3.  **Typography:** Change the font to 'Inter' and adjust letter-spacing for a modern, compact look.
    4.  **Answer Styling:** Make the answer text large, centered, and apply a silver-to-white gradient.
    5.  **Button Redesign:** Style the 'Ask' button with a minimal outline design.
    6.  **Add Theme Toggle:** Implement a button and the necessary JavaScript to switch themes and save the user's preference.
